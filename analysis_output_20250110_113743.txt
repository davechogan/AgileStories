--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORIGINAL STORY:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a unified platform user I want the max number of daily recurrences to be '6' so that I can setup a schedule that will run every 6 days.

ORIGINAL ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Verify that if a user is creating/editing a schedule with 'Interval' set to 'Daily', that the max number in 'Recur Every' is 6

ANALYSIS:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Analysis of current story (focusing on INVEST principles):

   - Independent: The story appears to be independent; it does not seem to rely on any other user story.
   - Negotiable: The details of how the system should behave are somewhat clear, but there's room for negotiation on how the user interaction should be designed.
   - Valuable: The value to the user is clear - they want to set up a schedule that runs every six days.
   - Estimable: The story seems fairly straightforward, and a developer should be able to estimate the effort needed to implement it.
   - Small: The story seems small enough to be completed in a single sprint.
   - Testable: The current acceptance criteria make the story testable, but they could be more specific.

2. Improved version of the story:

    As a unified platform user, I want to be able to set a maximum recurrence interval of 6 days for my schedules, so I can automate tasks to occur every six days.

3. Enhanced acceptance criteria:

   - When creating or editing a schedule with the 'Interval' set to 'Daily', the 'Recur Every' field should allow numbers up to 6.
   - If a user inputs a number greater than 6 in the 'Recur Every' field, the system should display an error message.
   - If a schedule is set with 'Recur Every' set to 6, the system should correctly schedule the task to occur every six days.
   - The user should be able to view and confirm the schedule settings after they have been saved.

4. Questions for clarification (if needed):
   
   - What should the error message say when a user tries to input a number greater than 6 in the 'Recur Every' field?
   - What happens if a user tries to input a non-numeric character in the 'Recur Every' field?
   - Is there a need for a minimum number in the 'Recur Every' field?
   - How should the system handle leap years or changes in daylight saving time?
