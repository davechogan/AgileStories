{"statusCode": 200, "body": "{\"analysis\": \"1. Analysis of current story (focusing on INVEST principles):\\n\\n   - Independent: The story appears to be independent; it does not seem to rely on any other user story.\\n   - Negotiable: The details of how the system should behave are somewhat clear, but there's room for negotiation on how the user interaction should be designed.\\n   - Valuable: The value to the user is clear - they want to set up a schedule that runs every six days.\\n   - Estimable: The story seems fairly straightforward, and a developer should be able to estimate the effort needed to implement it.\\n   - Small: The story seems small enough to be completed in a single sprint.\\n   - Testable: The current acceptance criteria make the story testable, but they could be more specific.\\n\\n2. Improved version of the story:\\n\\n    As a unified platform user, I want to be able to set a maximum recurrence interval of 6 days for my schedules, so I can automate tasks to occur every six days.\\n\\n3. Enhanced acceptance criteria:\\n\\n   - When creating or editing a schedule with the 'Interval' set to 'Daily', the 'Recur Every' field should allow numbers up to 6.\\n   - If a user inputs a number greater than 6 in the 'Recur Every' field, the system should display an error message.\\n   - If a schedule is set with 'Recur Every' set to 6, the system should correctly schedule the task to occur every six days.\\n   - The user should be able to view and confirm the schedule settings after they have been saved.\\n\\n4. Questions for clarification (if needed):\\n   \\n   - What should the error message say when a user tries to input a number greater than 6 in the 'Recur Every' field?\\n   - What happens if a user tries to input a non-numeric character in the 'Recur Every' field?\\n   - Is there a need for a minimum number in the 'Recur Every' field?\\n   - How should the system handle leap years or changes in daylight saving time?\", \"original_story\": \"As a unified platform user I want the max number of daily recurrences to be '6' so that I can setup a schedule that will run every 6 days.\", \"original_acceptance_criteria\": [\"Verify that if a user is creating/editing a schedule with 'Interval' set to 'Daily', that the max number in 'Recur Every' is 6\"], \"context\": \"Schedule configuration feature\", \"status\": \"success\"}"}
